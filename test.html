          		<p>As usual, Mike Nichols is telling stories. In many, he’s an awestruck bystander to his own biography, which is longer than you think: He’s 80. His maternal grandmother, he says, wrote the libretto for Strauss’s Salome. Her anarchist husband was bayoneted by German police. Henry Louis Gates mapped the family history. The Aga Khan took him up the Nile on his yacht. The Nazis chased him out of Berlin at age 7; upon arrival in New York, one of his only English phrases was “Please do not kiss me.” He married Diane Sawyer. “I know!” he says, when you look amazed.Other stories are self-portraits of putziness, exaggerated for your enjoyment. There’s his being “crazy on Halcion” for a while in the eighties. His supposed ineptitudes, unintentional insults, and superabundance of wives. (Sawyer is No. 4.) His years of impatience and imperiousness on sets. When he took the director of photography on one film out for a beer to figure out how to regain the crew’s trust, the D.P. told him, “It’s too late.” </p>

       		<p>No, this is not the first episode of Season 2 (although that is coming soon).   Instead I wanted to give you some insight into one of my between seasons projects, as I chat with writer and director Melanie Killingsworth about her film ‘The Apocalypse will be Automated’.  The film is about technology, morality and zombies which are all super interesting plus, I’m in it!  In the film.  So there’s that.</p>
